# stock-predictor
This is a python script to predict the price of Google stock (GOOGL) on a given day of the month. The script uses three different kernels of the Support Vector Regression classifier.
1. Radial Basis Function
2. Linear
3. Polynomial

The stock prices are plotted on a graph along with the three variations of the Support Vector Regression classifier.
The dataset was obtained from Yahoo Finance https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL/history?p=GOOGL
